# itm-362-project-2-master
This is the itm 362 fall project two.


Self critique: This Project was intense, I feel like I did a good job with the html, css, modular scale design. It was definalty a good learning experience and seeing what really goes into builiding a good website. I feel like this project could have gone a lot smoother, but unfortunately I had didn't have any motivated or dedicated team members they absolutly didn't care about the project or the team. Overall, I think I did a well learning new html and css techniques.

Team Critique:

Matt Giaimo: He did a very good job on this project, he spent hours researching and implementing things into the webpages. He also came up with the java script and designed most of the pages himself, because of the lack of effort our team memembers gave. This project would not be what is if it wasnt for Matt, and his personal repository will prove it. Overall, the work he did was excellent and he was a very dedicated team member.


Junhua Dong: He had good communication skills and was always concered on the project tunrin dates. He was the master for this project and he did a good job getting everything pushed to the master repository on a mpments notice. Overall, he did a good job and was a dedicated team member.


Feng Li & Andy Dimnych: These two team members showed Zero Dedication what so ever, They did not even communicate in the group chats or help on this project at all and Im sure their personal repositorys will reflect on that. They are very unprofessional will not work with or help these individuals again under any circumstants. They are very Welcome for getting handed the    "Free Grade".
